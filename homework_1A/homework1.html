			My name is Deanna Yee. I have a bachelor of science in computer science and engineering from University of California, Irvine. I volunteer at San Carlos library teaching middle schoolers how to code. I would like to make mobile apps as a career as well as a hobby. My hobbies are programming, tinkering with technology, hanging out with friends, being outdoors, and video games.

		<p id="CIS128">I am taking CIS 128 because I am working towards a certificate of achievement in web and mobile development and it is one of the requirements. I also would like to learn how to make websites that are both mobile and desktop friendly.</p>
